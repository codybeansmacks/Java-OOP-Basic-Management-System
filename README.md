# Java-OOP-Basic-Management-System

# Description
Java OOP Basic Management System is a comprehensive application developed to showcase object-oriented programming techniques in Java. The system simulates a basic management flow involving creating, transporting, storing, and purchasing food items. It encompasses various modules representing different stages of the management process: Factory, Transporter, Warehouse, and Customer. Each module allows users to input and manage specific details related to food items, such as creation, logistic information, storage, and customer purchase experience.

# Features

Users can create new food items, specifying details like name, category, expiry date, country of origin, and price.
# Transporter Module:
Manage transportation details of food items, including the transporter company, source, destination, and expected delivery date.
# Warehouse Module: 
Record the storage details of food items, including warehouse location and the date of receiving the items.
Customer Module: Customers can view the list of available food items, select, and purchase them.
# Rate Module:
Customers can rate the food items after purchasing and provide feedback and comments.
